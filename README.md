# Central Limit Theorem
quick overview:

central limit theorem means **average of your sample means will converge to the population means.**

z-score formula: \begin{equation} z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \end{equation}
where

$\bar{X} = $ sample mean

$\mu = $ population mean

$\sigma = $ population std

$n = $ population size
